In the past several months South America has seen a very fast-paced enterprising development, particularly at fintech industry. As part of the process, some of them have taken it to another level, becoming "unicorns", because of their size in terms of market cap.

The amazing phenomenon, alongside a region that historically has struggled in economic and social life conditions, carried us to wonder how could it be possible. And which factors could empower the movement. We suspected it has to be related to some common status in South American financial access societies.

We found out anual IMF's Financial Access Survey (FAS), a perfect fit for our questions. We used SQL to design our Relational Model, creating a Star with seven tables, each related by id_Economy and year fields: economy, cards, ATM's, digital transactions, depositors, loans, regional result.

Populating tables drove us to extract data with IMF's querying tools, filtering by country and year range (cuted from 2011 to latest available data). At this point we had to pick indicators and fix them in created tables; selection looked for a combination between geographical outreach and usage of financial services, the two FAS dimensions. At last, we complemented data with standardizing variables for comparisons, such as adult population or surface area, extracted from World Bank Open Data.
